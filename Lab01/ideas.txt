Exercise 1.1
	1. So I was kind of dumb and completely forgot that you mentioned that the book
	application was already mentioned in class, but if I can't do the book swap becaue 
	it's already been done, what about something similar to that,
	but for matching up landlords and students looking to rent. Landlords can put in their
	house for rent, how many people can rent, rent cost, weather utilities are included and
	so on, and students can query for places to rent in the app. Filters can be included in the
	app to help students rule out criteria that are dealbreakers for them and likewise with
	landlords if they so desire.

	2. So I work for Event technical services. I run sound and lighting for many events
	including Dance Guild and SAO concerts. My boss has a google sheet that he uses with all of
	the events on campus and we sign up for shifts in meetings. If we are put on a shift,
	he enters our initials into the cell of the event. When I sign up for shifts, I need to enter
	them into my calendar manually. What if there was a way to scan the sheet for the shifts I'm
	on (I know this isn't an app per se), and it automatically adds the event to my google
	calendar. But what if there was an app like google calendar, that had all of my shifts laid
	out, but it also had the event sheets and documentation built in to the "calendar event". 
	Event coordinators fill out event sheets to inform the tech assigned to the shift regarding
	the technical needs of the shift, and I always have a hard time finding the sheets because of
	bugs in the android google drive app. I know this isnt a great idea, but this is what I can
	think of.
