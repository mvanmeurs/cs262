Homework 3

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

So I couldn't get the app to work but I don't know whats wrong with it. I looked over
Elizabeths code and I thought I did everything right but I guess not. Hopefully I can
get partial credit.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
