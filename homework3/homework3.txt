Answer the following questions with respect both to the Web API you used in homework 2 and to the database you built in this homework.

Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.
	I think Firebase, at least how we have it implemented it, is RESTful. It's honestly hard to tell
	by looking at the code what is going on (since Elizabeth and Nathan have done all the firebase
	stuff). But hidden beneath all of the methods in our main.dart file, I can control click on the
	updateData method for example, and it seems to me like it invokes some sort of PUT function. I
	could be wrong though.

What endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?
	Idempotent: GET, PUT, DELETE
	Nullipotent: POST
